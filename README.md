# Evolution Mod
This mod is meant to simulate the natural selection of sheep.
We modified the color, reproduction, life cycle of sheep and the hunting behavior of wolves to simulate the natural selection in Minecraft using Java. 
Please use IntelliJ Idea open it, and run the build.gradle file.
After that, in the upper right corner, click gradle, and in fabric dropdown menu, click runClient.
